# flight_search_android_app
It's a very basic Android App where an user can search flights between an Origin and a Destination. User can also see both the locations in a Google Map. User can also store the search options so that it can be used later accordingly. As it is a very basic app, it has certain limitations. One of them is, you cannot book a ticket through this app. Payment options are not implemented as part of this project.
